I'll break down the implementation into clear, manageable phases:

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure**

1. Set up Next.js project with required dependencies
2. Create basic folder structure
3. Set up Supabase project and tables
4. Create basic UI layout

**Phase 2: Core Components Development**

1. Chat Interface
      - Basic chat UI
      - Message history
      - Input handling
2. Project Management
      - Project creation
      - File structure management
      - Database integration
3. Code Editor
      - Monaco Editor setup
      - File tree view
      - Basic editing functionality

**Phase 3: AI Integration & Code Generation**

1. AI Integration
      - Set up AI service
      - Create structured prompts
      - Implement code generation logic
2. Project Generation
      - Base project creation
      - File generation
      - Structure management
3. Code Updates
      - Real-time code updates

      - Recovery mechanisms

**Phase 6: Polish & Optimization**

1. UI/UX Improvements
      - Responsive design
      - Animations
      - Loading states
2. Performance
      - Code splitting
      - Bundle optimization
      - Caching strategies
3. Testing & Documentation
      - Unit tests
      - Integration tests
      - Documentation

Would you like to:

1. Start with Phase 1 and begin implementation?
2. Discuss any specific phase in more detail?
3. Modify the phase structure?
4. Focus on a particular component within a phase?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can start with the implementation
of your chosen phase.
